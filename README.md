# 🔮 Possible Future Enhancements

## 🗺️ Map Feature (Placeholder)
* **Currently:** As of now, the app includes a map feature that has hard coded coordinates it displays on the map.
* **Future Change:** This section was intentionally left as a placeholder, to later possibly implement an API to fetch grocery stores near the user and display them on the map.

## 🍲 Recipe Expansion
* **More Culinary Delights:** With the current limited selection, there's room for expanding the recipe collection to offer an even broader range of culinary experiences.

## 🌎 Explore More Cuisines
* **Cuisine Categories:** Introducing of buttons or filters to allow users to explore recipes based on different cuisines, enhancing the app's versatility.
